# Gof Design Pattern

### Creational Design Patterns

| Pattern name     | description |
| --- | --- |
| Singleton        | The singleton pattern restricts the initialization of a class to ensure that only one instance of the class can be created. |
| Factory          | The factory pattern takes out the responsibility of instantiating a object from the class to a Factory class.               |
| Abstract Factory | Allows us to create a Factory for factory classes.                                                                          |
| Builder          | Creating an object step by step and a method to finally get the object instance.                                         |
| Prototype        | Creating a new object instance from another similar instance and then modify according to our requirements.                 |

### Structural Design Patterns

| Pattern name     | description |
| --- | --- |
| Adapter	|Provides an interface between two unrelated entities so that they can work together.|
| Composite|	Used when we have to implement a part-whole hierarchy. For example, a diagram made of other pieces such as circle, square, triangle, etc.|
|Proxy|	Provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.|
|Flyweight	|Caching and reusing object instances, used with immutable objects. For example, string pool.|
|Facade|	Creating a wrapper interfaces on top of existing interfaces to help client applications.|
|Bridge |The bridge design pattern is used to decouple the interfaces from implementation and hiding the implementation details from the client program.|
|Decorator	| The decorator design pattern is used to modify the functionality of an object at runtime.|

### Behavioral Design Patterns

| Pattern name | description |
| --- | --- |
| Template Method	| used to create a template method stub and defer some of the steps of implementation to the subclasses.|
|Mediator	|used to provide a centralized communication medium between different objects in a system.|
|Chain of Responsibility	|used to achieve loose coupling in software design where a request from the client is passed to a chain of objects to process them.|
|Observer|	useful when you are interested in the state of an object and want to get notified whenever there is any change.|
|Strategy|	Strategy pattern is used when we have multiple algorithm for a specific task and client decides the actual implementation to be used at runtime.|
|Command|	Command Pattern is used to implement lose coupling in a request-response model.|
|State|	State design pattern is used when an Object change it’s behavior based on it’s internal state.|
|Visitor|	Visitor pattern is used when we have to perform an operation on a group of similar kind of Objects.|
|Interpreter|	defines a grammatical representation for a language and provides an interpreter to deal with this grammar.|
|Iterator|	used to provide a standard way to traverse through a group of Objects.|
|Memento|	The memento design pattern is used when we want to save the state of an object so that we can restore later on.|
