Memento design pattern is one of the behavioral design pattern. Memento design pattern is used when we want to save the state of an object so that we can restore later on. Memento pattern is used to implement this in such a way that the saved state data of the object is not accessible outside of the object, this protects the integrity of saved state data.

Originator is the object whose state needs to be saved and restored and it uses an inner class to save the state of Object. The inner class is called Memento and it’s private, so that it can’t be accessed from other objects.

Caretaker is the helper class that is responsible for storing and restoring the Originator’s state through Memento object. Since Memento is private to Originator, Caretaker can’t access it and it’s stored as an Object within the caretaker.
